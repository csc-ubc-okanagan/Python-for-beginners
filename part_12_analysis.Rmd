So far we have looked at cleaning, summarizing, and subsetting data, with some minor calculations, but we haven't yet looked at analyzing our data.

Python is a very powerful tool for data analysis. Similarly to R, we can fit linear models and view graphs. First, we will look at some basic data analysis processes in Python.

Let's re-load in our Gapminder data:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstaf/gapminder/master/gapminder/gapminder.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```



```{python}
import pandas_profiling as pp
pp.ProfileReport(df)
```

```{r}
1+1
```
